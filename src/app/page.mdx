## About Netpick {{ anchor: false }}

Netpick is built on the philosophy of modularity. Just like building blocks, you can use modules independently or combine them to create a powerful, unified system for your business.

The goal is to create a seamless experience where data flows freely between different parts of your operations, from gathering leads to managing customer relationships and executing marketing campaigns.

### MailMine

**MailMine** is the first module in the Netpick family. Developed as a standalone product, it serves as a powerful web scraping and lead generation tool.

In the future, MailMine will be available as an installable module within the Netpick ecosystem, allowing retrieved leads to be directly fed into your Netpick CRM and marketing pipelines.
